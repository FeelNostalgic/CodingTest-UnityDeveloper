# Coding Test from an interview

## 1. BUTTON ACTIONS
   
Create three buttons in the main view of the application. The buttons should have different graphics of your choice. Their initial position won't matter too much as they will move from side to side. Each button can be interacted with in the following way:

- When the user is hovering over the button for more than 0.5 seconds a tooltip should appear above the button. Each button shall display a different text in its tooltip.
- When the user clicks on a button, a closable pop-up shall appear. The pop up shall have a text in it that shall be different for each button.
- The user shall be able to drag each button around the screen, and the other buttons shall move according to the movement of the button, i.e. no button may be on top of another button, the one that the user is not moving must be moved so as not to be below the first one.
- When the user right-clicks on a button, its colour must change. If click on a red button it will change to green, if you click on a green one it will change to blue and if you click on a blue one it will change to green. and if you click on a blue button it will turn back to red.


## 2. RECORDING AND REPLAY
   
Create a save system whereby user actions can be recorded, saved and replayed later. Place the controls for this feature (Start/Stop recording button, input field for the name and Load and Play recording buttons) at the top of the screen.

- To specify which recording should be started or saved the user has to enter the name in an input field.
- Once you have started recording by clicking on the Start Recording button, it will change to the Stop Recording button.
- When the recording stops after pressing the Stop Recording button, the recording will be saved.
- If the user makes and saves a recording, he/she shall be able to play it back even if the application is restarted.
- When the recording is playing back, the saved actions should be displayed in the same sequence and speed in which they were recorded.
- The saved actions will include all the button interactions described above.
- When starting and stopping a recording with a previously used name, the previous recording shall be replaced by the new one.
